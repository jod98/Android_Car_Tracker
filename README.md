# Android_Car_Tracker
With the increased threat of car theft in the modern era, I decided to repurpose an old Android phone to become a car tracker. Using the 'Tasker' application, I had the ability to program this device to transmit it's current location via an API request. This solution offers a significant price advantage compared to similar methods whereby a constant mobile data (4G) connection is not required.
